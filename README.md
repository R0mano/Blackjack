# Blackjack

BlackJack is a popular casino card game. The player tries to beat the dealer by having a better hand than him without going over 21.
Each card is worth her face value, Jacks, Queens and Kings are also worth 10 and Aces are worth 11 or 1 depending whichever makes a better hand.
Beating the dealer pays 2 for 1. BlackJack (two cards: one Ace, one of a value of 10) pays 3 for 2.
